      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>FiveYellowMice is a human being born and living on planet Earth. Contrary to common belief, it does not exist in mouse form in real life, its number is also 1 rather than 5. The name FiveYellowMice was created by its random thought on some day in the 2010s, from the need of creating an online account while not wanting to use its real name.</p>
      <p>Despite have "mice" in its name, FiveYellowMice has an obsession for cats Internet cat photos and videos, as well as physical cats, are known to produce happy emotions on FiveYellowMice.
